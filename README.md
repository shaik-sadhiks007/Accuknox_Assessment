# Accuknox_Assessment

# Overview
This project is a dynamic dashboard application built with React, Redux, Bootstrap, and ViteJS. It allows users to manage categories and widgets efficiently with a responsive user interface.

# Technologies Used
- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: State management for predictable application state.
- Bootstrap: Styling framework for responsive design.
- ViteJS: Build tool for fast development and bundling.
  
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
